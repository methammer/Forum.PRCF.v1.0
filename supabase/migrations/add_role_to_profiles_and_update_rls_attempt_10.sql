  # Add Role to Profiles and Update RLS (Attempt 10 - Simplify User Update WITH CHECK)

  This migration continues to introduce an admin role and update RLS policies.
  The primary change in this attempt is to drastically simplify the `WITH CHECK`
  clause of the "Users can update their own profile (non-restricted fields)." policy
  to its most basic form: `NEW.id = OLD.id`.
  This is an attempt to isolate the persistent "missing FROM-clause entry for table 'new'"
  error by testing the simplest possible usage of `NEW` and `OLD` in an UPDATE policy.

  1. Table Modifications
     - `public.profiles`
       - Added `"role"` column (TEXT, default 'user', NOT NULL): Stores user role. (Idempotent)

  2. Helper Function
     - `public.can_user_update_own_profile` (Remains REMOVED)

  3. New/Updated Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
     - `public.profiles`:
       - "Users can update their own profile (non-restricted fields).":
         - `USING` clause: `(auth.uid() = id)`.
         - `WITH CHECK` clause SIMPLIFIED to: `NEW.id = OLD.id`.
           (This temporarily removes protection against users changing their own role/status,
            for debugging purposes).
       - Admin policies remain as in Attempt 9.
     - `public.forum_categories` & `public.forum_posts`: Admin RLS policies remain unchanged.

  4. Important Notes
     - The `"role"` column defaults to 'user'.
     - This attempt focuses on finding a baseline working `WITH CHECK` clause for `NEW`/`OLD`.

-- 1. Add role column to profiles table (idempotent)
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'role'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN "role" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.profiles."role" IS 'User role, e.g., ''user'', ''moderator'', ''admin''';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 2. Ensure the helper function is removed (if it exists from previous attempts)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.can_user_update_own_profile(public.profiles, public.profiles);

-- 3. RLS Policies for public.profiles

-- Users can view their own profile
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read their own profile." ON public.profiles; -- old name
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile." ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile."
  ON public.profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile." ON public.profiles; -- old name
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile (non-restricted fields)." ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile (non-restricted fields)."
  ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING ( auth.uid() = id ) -- The user must own the row
  WITH CHECK (
    -- SIMPLIFIED: Only check if ID is changed.
    -- This is to test the most basic NEW/OLD comparison.
    -- Previous more complex checks for role/status are temporarily removed for debugging.
    NEW.id = OLD.id
  );

-- Admins RLS for profiles
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all profiles." ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can read all profiles."
  ON public.profiles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING ( (SELECT pro."role" FROM public.profiles pro WHERE pro.id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' );

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update status and role of any profile." ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update status and role of any profile."
  ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING ( (SELECT pro."role" FROM public.profiles pro WHERE pro.id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' ) -- Updater must be an admin
  WITH CHECK (
    (SELECT pro."role" FROM public.profiles pro WHERE pro.id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' AND -- Double check updater is admin
    -- Admin cannot change these specific fields for other users (or themselves via this policy)
    (NEW.username = OLD.username OR (NEW.username IS NULL AND OLD.username IS NULL)) AND
    (NEW.full_name = OLD.full_name OR (NEW.full_name IS NULL AND OLD.full_name IS NULL)) AND
    (NEW.avatar_url = OLD.avatar_url OR (NEW.avatar_url IS NULL AND OLD.avatar_url IS NULL)) AND
    (NEW.website = OLD.website OR (NEW.website IS NULL AND OLD.website IS NULL)) AND
    NEW.id = OLD.id -- Admin cannot change a user's ID (PK, not NULL)
    -- Admin *can* change NEW."role" and NEW.status via this policy.
  );

-- 4. RLS Policies for public.forum_categories (Unchanged from previous attempt)

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all categories." ON public.forum_categories;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all categories."
  ON public.forum_categories FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING ( (SELECT pro."role" FROM public.profiles pro WHERE pro.id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' )
  WITH CHECK ( (SELECT pro."role" FROM public.profiles pro WHERE pro.id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' );

-- 5. RLS Policies for public.forum_posts (Unchanged from previous attempt)

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all posts." ON public.forum_posts;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all posts."
  ON public.forum_posts FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING ( (SELECT pro."role" FROM public.profiles pro WHERE pro.id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' )
  WITH CHECK ( (SELECT pro."role" FROM public.profiles pro WHERE pro.id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' );
