  # Add Role to Profiles and Update RLS (Attempt 11 - Ultra-Minimal UPDATE Policy)

  This migration attempts to isolate the "missing FROM-clause entry for table 'new'" error
  by drastically simplifying the RLS policies on the `profiles` table, focusing on
  a very basic UPDATE policy that uses NEW and OLD.

  1. Table Modifications
     - `public.profiles`
       - Added `"role"` column (TEXT, default 'user', NOT NULL). (Idempotent)

  2. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies on `public.profiles`
     - RLS Enabled.
     - "Users can view their own profile.": `SELECT` using `auth.uid() = id`.
     - "Users can insert their own profile.": `INSERT` with check `auth.uid() = id`.
     - "Users can update own profile (basic check).": `UPDATE` using `auth.uid() = id`
       AND `WITH CHECK (NEW.id = OLD.id AND NEW.role = OLD.role)`.
       This is the key policy being tested.
     - ALL Admin-specific policies for `profiles` are COMMENTED OUT for this test.
     - The generic `Allow authenticated users to read profiles` from the initial migration is dropped.
     - The original `Users can update own profile` policy from the initial migration is dropped.


  3. Important Notes
     - This is a diagnostic step. If this fails, the issue with NEW/OLD in WITH CHECK
       is very fundamental in this environment for the profiles table.
     - If this passes, we can incrementally add back complexity.

-- 0. Drop potentially conflicting old policies from 0_create_profiles_table.sql
-- The original "Users can update own profile" did not use NEW/OLD in its check.

-- 1. Add role column to profiles table (idempotent)

-- Note: ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is idempotent.
-- If RLS is already enabled, this command does nothing.
