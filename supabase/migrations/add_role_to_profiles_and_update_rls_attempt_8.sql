  # Add Role to Profiles and Update RLS (Attempt 8 - Inline RLS Logic)

  This migration introduces an admin role and updates Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
  It removes the PL/pgSQL helper function `public.can_user_update_own_profile` due to
  errors with `NEW`/`OLD` record passing. The logic for users updating their own profiles
  is now directly inlined into the `WITH CHECK` clause of the relevant policy.

  1. Table Modifications
     - `public.profiles`
       - Added `"role"` column (TEXT, default 'user', NOT NULL): Stores user role. (Idempotent)

  2. Helper Function
     - `public.can_user_update_own_profile` (REMOVED)

  3. New/Updated Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
     - `public.profiles`:
       - "Users can update their own profile (non-restricted fields).":
         - `USING` clause remains `(auth.uid() = id)`.
         - `WITH CHECK` clause now directly checks that `id`, `role`, and `status` fields are not changed by the user:
           `(NEW.id = OLD.id AND NEW."role" IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD."role" AND NEW.status IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.status)`
       - Other policies (Admin RLS, user view RLS) remain similar to previous attempts.
     - `public.forum_categories` & `public.forum_posts`: Admin RLS policies remain.

  4. Important Notes
     - The `"role"` column defaults to 'user'.
     - The RLS logic for users updating their own profiles is now self-contained in the policy definition.
